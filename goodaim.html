				        	<p class="description"> This was a <span class="bolder">7 week project</span> done in collaboration with Jonathon Bergeron from Electronic Arts/Popcap. Given the prompt to explore the creation of a mobile app that uses some aspect of gamification to change behavior, my group explored the realms of charity, volunteering, and random acts of kindness. We agreed on two overarching values to guide our design: societal impact and long term personal change.</p>

				        	<p class="description"> With mobile being part of the project requirements, we wanted to <span class="bolder">highlight the strenghts of mobile games</span>. Three advantages stuck out to us: mobile allows for various modes of play, can augment daily life, and can embrace varying environments.  

				        	We also looked to <span class="bolder"> improve upon the foundation of Pokemon Go</span>. We wanted a game mechanic that involves more skill than simply swiping, level restricted gear to improve progression, at-home/stationary play, and a questing system to promote play and increase purpose.</p>
				        	<p class="sub-title"> Charity Theory </p>
				        	<p class="description">Researching charity theory showed us that <span class="bolder">scope insensitivity </span>is bias that occurs when a problem seems too big or unidentifiable. To overcome this, we embodied select community issues in the form of a monster to make the problem more personal and close to home. We also saw that emotional happiness was important. The <span class="bolder">Charity Happiness Cycle </span>taught us that happier people give more. Taking advantage of this cycle could help increase player retention rates and create a positive impact on the mental and emotional lives of players. We knew from this that our game theme needed to be cheerful and playful. </p>

The map turned out to be a great exercise for organizing and contextualizing what our topics meant internally to each team member.</p>
				        	<p class="sub-title"> Popular Media Scan </p>
				        	<p class="description">While the magazine cover media scan was easy to organize and display, I feel that it would have been more effective to focus on different forms of media, such as facebook articles or twitter feeds. Looking back, these alternative media forms would have been more applicable to a younger or mobile based generation. Unfortunately, we did not have multiple audiences in mind while conducting our media scan.</p>

				        	<p class="description">We began by individually brain dumping all that we had gathered from two weeks of research. We then sat down together to share our dumps and ideate various solutions. During our first session we generated over 40 ideas in the space of volunteering, RAKs, and charity. We used a 2x2 matrix to remove/combine similar ideas and eliminate those with weak gami cation.
				        	</p>
				        	<p class="description">The action words exercise was especially helpful in rejuvenating the team's creativity after a long ideation session. We spent exactly one minute applying various action words to the realm of charity, volunteering, and RAKs. The six most beneficial interpretations are pictured above.</p>

							<!-- <p class="highlight">Social Impact + Behavior Change + Fun Factor</p> -->
							<p class="description">Looking back, this was a critical and successful moment for our group. This method gave everyone a fair say in the decision process and helped some of our strongest concepts come forward. Where we could have improved was in our 18 concept explanations. Sometimes the voting was skewed simply because the words on the sticky note did not fully convey the idea the creator had in mind.</p>

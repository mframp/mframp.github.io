				        		An Arduino board is used as the core of the controller. We tried various sensors including accelerometer, gyroscope, and proximity sensor, but eventually found the flex and light sensors to give us the <span class="bolder">highest returns with the lowest implementation difficulty</span>. A basic vibration motor is used in the palm of the glove to provide haptic feedback. We printed a chassis to <span class="bolder">contain the entire system </span>on the arm and wrist.
